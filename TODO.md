# TODO
+ Correct and finalize Internationalization of everything (I think I broke it a bit)
+ Complete out any additional Tour tabs (systray, etc)
+ Identify if YAD is supposed to spawn processes for each Notebook tab, fix it if not
+ Pressing LEFT and RIGHT arrows instead of UP and DOWN arrows hangs the app?
+ Identify if using --picture can actually function how --image is working now to maybe better organize and structure tab dialogs
+ dialog centering isn't working correctly on screens with resolution of 1024x768?

## Completed
+ Add more Tabs for other MX Tools and other features - no more tabs will be added until user feedback
+ Add links to MX wiki and MX Manual entries within text dialogs
+ Refine current text dialogs to a initial final product
+ Refine images a bit more for a initial final product
+ Fix window-icon not working
