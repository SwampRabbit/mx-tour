Updates in MX KDE are handled by the Discover application.

When updates are available, the Discover icon will appear with a red dot on it in the System Tray area of the panel.

You can then Left-Click the Discover icon in the System Tray and it will open to show you available updates.

You can install all available updates or selectively choose the ones you want.

Right-Clicking the Discover icon allows you to
    • Open Discover
    • See Updates
    • Refresh
    • Quit
