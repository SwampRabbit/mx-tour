Quick System Info, also known as QSI, is a great and easy way to get a lot of information about your computer hardware and MX Linux installation.

The output is automatically copied to the clipboard, it can also be pasted directly into a MX Forum post complete with code tags, or pasted into a Text document for use later.

It is important to include your QSI when asking for help on the MX Forum so that the MX Community can better help you.  

FAQ: QSI automatically filters potentially sensitive information, this information will instead show as "<filter>".
