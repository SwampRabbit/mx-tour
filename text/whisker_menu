The Whisker Menu (Applications Menu) is an easy to use and flexible main menu.

It consists of four main areas:
(1) Application Categories
(2) Individual Applications
(3) System Quick Links
(4) Search bar

You can open the Whisker Menu by Left-Clicking on it or pressing the "Windows" key on your keyboard.

You can browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on the categories on the side. Additionally, Whisker Menu keeps a list of the last ten Recently Used applications.

When you first open it you are shown a list of applications marked as favorites.  Favorites are easy to add and remove by Right-Clicking on any application and select “Add to Favorites”. Simply drag and drop your favorites list to arrange them.

If you’re not sure exactly where a program is listed, the search field is automatically focused when opening the menu, so you can just search by application name or general words such as "browser".

You can edit the Whisker Menu properties by Right-Clicking on it.
