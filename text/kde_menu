The Application Menu is an easy to use and flexible main menu.

It consists of five main areas:
(1) Favorites Quick Links
(2) Recent Applications and Files
(3) Application Categories
(4) Search bar
(5) System Quick Links

You can open the Application Menu by Left-Clicking on it or pressing the "Windows" key on your keyboard.

You can browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on the categories on the side.

Favorites are easy to add, reorder, and remove by Right-Clicking on any application and select “Add to Favorites”. Simply drag and drop your favorites list to arrange them.

If you’re not sure exactly where a program is listed, the search field is automatically focused when opening the menu, so you can just search by application name or general words such as "browser".

You can edit the Application Menu properties by Right-Clicking on it.
