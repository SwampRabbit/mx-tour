# About MX Tour

Take a tour of MX Linux 21.

Using a new Operating System for the first time can seem challenging and scary.

MX Tour is designed to quickly introduce and orient you to many of the features and graphical tools of the different Desktop Editions of MX Linux (Xfce, KDE, and Fluxbox).

## Background
MX Tour initially was just a Proof of Concept MX Linux 21 Tour Guide application created using only Yet Another Dialog (YAD).  After good reception and interest, it was expanded, still using just YAD, to become a full fledge application that hopefully can be useful to new users.
